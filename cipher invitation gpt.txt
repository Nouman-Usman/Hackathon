Hey everyone, I'm stoked to tell you about something I've been pouring my heart into - Cipher Craft, a hackathon extravaganza that I've been leading. It's been quite a journey since we kicked off in 2022, and our latest hackathon drew in a whopping 500+ participants, cementing our status as Lahore's go-to tech event.

What makes Cipher Craft stand out is the vibe - it's all about inclusivity. We're rolling out the welcome mat for tech enthusiasts from every nook and cranny of Pakistan, including high schoolers right from our own backyard. And guess what? We're not just about hacking away; we're mixing it up with some killer workshops too.

But here's the kicker - Cipher Craft is totally, absolutely, 100% free for everyone. Yep, you heard that right. No entry fees, no strings attached. Why? Because we've noticed that many hackathons in Pakistan slap on a registration fee, and that's a bummer for folks who might be tight on resources. We're flipping the script on that one, making sure that money doesn't stand in the way of anyone's chance to join in the fun.

So mark your calendars for September 20th to 22nd, 2024, and get ready to dive into three days packed with hacking, learning, and making connections. Let's make Cipher Craft the most epic tech gathering yet! Check out our website for all the deets: https://ciphercrafthackathon.netlify.app/.
